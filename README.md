# Overview

Flash-DBSim for Linux ports the flash simulator [Flash-DBSim](http://kdelab.ustc.edu.cn/flash-dbsim/index_en.html), originally implemented for Windows, to be used in Linux based systems.
A flash simulator emulates in the memory the behavior of a flash memory. Thus, it consists of an interesting and promising environment to execute experiments, such as the evaluation of index structures using [FESTIval](https://accarniel.github.io/FESTIval/).
